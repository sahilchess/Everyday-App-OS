A comprehensive collection of essential everyday applications built in Python, designed as a unified platform similar to an operating system. This project features six fully functional applications accessible through a single interface:

🧮 **Calculator** - A feature-rich calculator with a visual ASCII interface supporting basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

🔐 **Password Generator** - Secure password creation tool that generates customizable passwords with letters, numbers, and special characters

🎲 **Dice Roller Simulator** - Customizable dice rolling application supporting multiple dice with variable sides for gaming and probability experiments

🧠 **Quizzler** - Interactive quiz game with multiple categories testing general knowledge with score tracking

🎮 **Hangman** - Classic word guessing game featuring multiple topics (programming languages, sports, animals, food, colors) with ASCII art hangman stages

🧮 **Roman Numeral Converter** - Bidirectional converter supporting both Arabic-to-Roman and Roman-to-Arabic number conversion

Future plans include expanding this into a web-based application with additional utilities like a stock price checker, weather app, and other everyday tools, creating a comprehensive digital toolkit accessible through a modern web interface.
